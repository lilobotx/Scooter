    <h1>About</h1>
    <h2>We make dangerous scooters. (Well I hope not)</h2>
    <h3>Super F started the development of our flagship product The Scooter in 2012. It all started with humble beningings at beckwith park and later at what would be champions field. Engineer Bob Bronze would stumble on a genius idea togheter with his Grandplat. What if scooters could be rocket propelled through the air and compete in the Scooter Soccer Champion Ships (SSCS). When Bob Bronze check the official rules for the competition, nothing ever disallowed the use of rocket boost. There were old rumors that youth would create their own cola powered boostes using 2 liter cola bottles. It was said that they scored a impossible goal using these coke powered boosts. So when Mr. Bronze came up to Grandplat and said what if we could make this but better then we went into the workshop and immediately started working on a prototype that later became the Rocket Boosts. We finally created flying scooters after 2 years of work but it was highly dangerous and made development take a year extra to expand safety features. Today we have sold more then 8 million units and are continuing strong providing support for out scooters by educating on repair and replacement parts. Our scooters are officially endorsed by the SSCS and we definetly did not buy the entire competition by 2020. That is it.</h3>
